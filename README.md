# Dectecting and Predicting Clusters of Evolving Binary Stars

## Project Description

As astrophysicists continue to collect data on binary star systems in our galaxy, new possibilities for research emerge. Large databases exist full of binary star data. This includes attributes such as red shift, mass ratio, hydrogen ratio, etc. Astrophysicists would like the ability to organize this data into clusters so that any two systems with similar attributes are in the same cluster and dissimilar systems are in different clusters. Astrophysicists have also computed their own data for future states of binary systems. This would add the dimension of time to the data (since the lifetime of a binary star could be millions of years, simulating future states is necessary). By organizing clusters by time, further analysis can be taken as binary stars mature.

## About Binary Stars

Taking a step back, the formation of any star begins with a nebula of interstellar dust which, over a timespan of millions of years, condenses into a star. A majority of the time, two or more stars form out of a nebula. In fact, four-fifths of stars visible in the night sky are actually binary or multi-star systems. Many of these binary systems are so close together that only a single point of light is visible; astronomers need to measure features of emitted wavelengths of light to classify them. The first binary stars were discovered by Galileo in 1617. Ever since then, astronomers have been studying their various properties.
